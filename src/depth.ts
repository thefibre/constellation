// Depth for the moving web: what is near, what is far, and what the pointer
// brings forward.
//
// the designer, 2026-09-14, after showing the map to somebody who was deeply
// interested: *"the 3D effect can also be more strong. Smaller and bigger.
// Bringing pieces to the foreground"*, and *"nodes are full (means: have
// content) or empty (they are unclear or there for overview purposes)"*.
//
// The picture is still flat SVG; depth is a number per node, 0 (far) to 1
// (near), and everything that SELLS depth is read from it:
//
//   size       near names are larger, far ones smaller
//   light      far names are fainter
//   focus      far names are slightly soft (a small blur)
//   parallax   as the pointer moves, near things move more than far things,
//              in opposite directions either side of the middle distance
//   order      near things are painted over far things
//
// What decides a node's depth is what it MEANS, so the effect carries
// information rather than decoration: the middle is nearest, a strong
// connection nearer than a weak one, a name with something written on it
// nearer than an empty one, and whatever you point at comes forward with
// everything it is connected to — the rest steps back.
//
// Pure: no clock, no DOM. The component eases each node's depth toward
// `targetDepth` a little every frame, so coming forward is a movement.
