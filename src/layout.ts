// The moving web: one person in the middle, their strongest connections
// floating around them.
//
// From the design brief: *"Is the map not moving? Like the thesaurus... a moving
// web of connection. You click on a name (not a dot) and then you see the
// connections.. you click on the next... and that one is centered (and
// bigger) and you see the most valuable connection of that person... you can
// always go Back."*
//
// ── Why this moves when the overview does not ──────────────────────────────
//
// A static overview map refuses a simulation: where
// everybody lives must never change, or spatial memory is worthless. This is
// the other view. It shows ONE neighbourhood at a time, and the movement IS
// the information — the person you clicked travelling to the centre is how you
// see that the whole picture is now about them. Stability here would mean a
// jump cut, which loses where you came from.
//
// ── The forces, all of them ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ── Wide, because a screen is wide (design brief) ────────────────────
//
// *"Make it more wide... spread out... Make it wide over the screen."* The
// cloud is an ELLIPSE, not a circle: the ring a name is pulled to is stretched
// horizontally by ASPECT, so the names use the width a monitor actually has
// instead of leaving two empty columns either side of a disc.
//
// ── Nothing joins directly; everything joins through a topic ──────────────
//
// From the design brief: *"If you look, lines are always
// via nodes"*, *"no direct lines"*, *"the node is that a topic/theme/tag —
// without showing it... maybe only with a mouseover"*.
//
// So a line never runs from the middle straight to a name. It runs to a small
// JUNCTION, and from there to everyone who shares that one thing — a tag, an
// employer, a stated relationship. The junction IS the reason, and it carries
// no label until you hover it, which keeps the picture names-only while making
// the grouping visible: three people hanging off one dot are three people who
// share something, and you can see that before you read anything.
//
// A junction is a real node in the simulation, not a drawn midpoint. That is
// what makes the lines bend and flex as the cloud moves (From the design brief: *"which makes
// the movements more flex"*) — a computed midpoint would stay rigidly straight.
//
// ── Dragging is dragging, not steering (design brief) ───────────────
//
// *"The drag is actually - click and drag (not just follow...) dragging the
// item... the rest follows in a delay, forming a flock, that gradually spreads
// around the item once you dropped."*
//
// Drag the name in the middle and the whole cloud streams after it, each name
// on its own lag — that falls out of the anchors above, which chase the middle
// wherever it is, pointer included. What did NOT fall out is the landing: the
// middle used to be sprung to the origin, so letting go snapped the cloud back
// to where it started. A dropped middle now KEEPS ITS PLACE (`homeX`/`homeY`),
// and the flock spreads around it there.
//
// ── Never fixed (same message) ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// *"by dragging, you could see people coming in... and moving out.. it is
// always a bit moving... not fixed.... so you can move it around, and make
// things visible that are a bit hidden."*
//
// Two things do that. A dragged name is `held`: it follows the pointer and
// every other name reacts, which is how you shake something out from behind a
// neighbour. And the cloud never fully freezes — a slow WANDER keeps it
// breathing, so it reads as alive rather than as a diagram.
//
// ── The middle leans toward your mouse (design brief) ────────────────
//
// *"make the main name, follow the mouse in a delay"*. The name in the middle
// drifts after the pointer, softly and always behind it. It LEANS rather than
// follows: the pull is a fraction of the distance and capped, because the
// middle of a cloud that chases your cursor to the edge of the frame stops
// being the middle of anything, and the lines to every other name would
// stretch across the screen.
//
//   the centre      pulled toward where you are pointing, softly and capped
//
// ── And the rest follows, each on its own (design brief) ─────────────
//
// *"when the center follows, the rest moves — again with a delay — ... some
// lines become longer, others shorter"*, and then: *"the following should be
// all independent connections... not as a block... so the connecting strings
// stretch and contract independent"*.
//
// So the ring is not pinned to the middle of the frame, and there is no single
// anchor either. EVERY NAME CARRIES ITS OWN, which trails the centre at its
// own rate. The centre leans after your mouse; each name comes after the
// centre at its own pace, some quick, some slow. The strings therefore stretch
// and contract independently rather than the cloud sliding as one piece — the
// first version used one shared anchor and moved exactly like a block.
//
// The rate is derived from the name's id, so it is that person's own lag: the
// same every time you visit them, never a random shimmer.
//   a neighbour     pulled to a ring whose radius is its weight: the most
//                   valuable connection sits closest
//   two linked      pulled together, so people who share something sit near
//   neighbours      each other and the web shows the community's own shape
//                   rather than a star
//   every name      steered toward its own direction around the ring
//
// ── Directions are assigned, not hoped for ─────────────────────────────────
//
// The forces alone do not spread the names. Link springs pull clusters
// together and the whole cloud slides onto one side of the centre, leaving the
// other half empty — seen twice in the browser, at two different sizes. So
// each name is given a slot around the ring and steered toward it
// (`assignBearings`), and the springs only refine what the slots decide.
// Emergent spreading looked elegant and did not work.
//
// A weak all-pairs push was tried first, against the same problem, and it is
// gone: measured with the slots in place it changed the widest empty wedge by
// at most one degree. Slots did the job; the push was a constant with a
// justification that had stopped being true.
//   two labels      pushed apart when their names would overlap
//   everything      damped, so it settles instead of orbiting
//
// ── The glide (design brief) ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// *"If you click on a related word: that word moves towards the center... the
// word you came from moves to the side (left, right, bottom, up... opposite
// to where the second word first was)."*
//
// That is one movement, not two: the whole cloud slides so the clicked name
// arrives at the middle. Everything else comes along, which puts the old
// centre exactly opposite the direction the clicked name came from, for free.
// `pan` carries the translation and how far through it we are. Moving the
// nodes individually would have them cross each other and lose the sense of
// travelling somewhere.
//
// The glide EASES IN AND OUT (From the design brief: "make the movements a bit
// more ease in and out"). Spending a fixed FRACTION of what remains each frame
// — the obvious way — starts at full speed and crawls at the end, which reads
// as a lurch followed by a drift. A cubic ease over a fixed number of frames
// starts gently, travels fastest in the middle, and arrives gently.
//
// While it travels, the springs are turned down. Otherwise the cloud is being
// slid and rearranged at the same time: the old centre gets pulled off its
// bearing mid-flight and no longer lands opposite the name you clicked, which
// is the one thing the movement is supposed to show. So the glide is mostly a
// TRAVEL, and the settling happens when it arrives.
//
// Pure: no clock, no DOM. The component calls `step` once per frame until
// `energy` is small.
